7/23 Week 1
-------------
B4 class
---
Books:
"corporate information factory" by W.H.Inmon which supports up-to-down approach in DW

---
Questions about why we are here?
what kind of goals we needs to archieve when we finished this subjects?
what kind of chanlleges of this industry has faced today and how we can handle thoes problems w/ DH?

feeling
---
the first class is really difficult for me.
although i've prepared a little bit but it's still not enough.

class notes and questions
---
outlines:
1>what is diff btw DW and Operational DB?
2>integration of diff src of data
3>trasaction processing and support
4>data exploration and DM
5>BD magmt

what is DB?
-a collection of records
-shared access -> AC
-a central repository

main components that makes a db.
files  <-> tables
records<-> rows
fields <-> clms

Busi drivers:
consumer demand
competition&complexity
operating efficiencies
->
responding to changes:
BI+BM+BO

who is DW for?
user: manager/DMaker
data:summaries, over time to detect patterns and trends
needs:diff processing rqmts-> rsp time greatly relxed?
      Q:why -> DW's aim is to store multi type of data(not for quick access?
      what does it means? by highly variable -> many types?
Platform:separated from operations
-separate sys? -> what does sys means here ? what functions?
-separate data stores

unstructured data:
hard to find rlshp btw elements/data? X-> 0/1?


DW-DEF-Feature
1>subject-ori -> fcs on modelling & ana of data, not org's ongoing oper??
2>integrated -> put diff type into DW -> increase efficiency of DA
3>time-variant -> it's an imptt dim -> why it's imptt? -> 
  only w/ the time the data can have the trends/ pattern??
4>non-volatile -> historical data won't be updated.

Diff btw OLTP AND OLAP
---
OLTP pvds src to DW than OLAP sys help to ana it.
OLTP: 
fast qry prcs + data integity + multi-access envir + effectiveness
OLAPï¼š
low vlm of tran + qry(cmplx) + resp time(measure) + multi-dimensional schemas

The structure/step of DW:   
operational db-> staging(ETL) -> DW -> Mart 

ODB and DW
odb likes cache? DW likes hardware?

odb:
current data, constructed for known tasks?? search particular rcds?
continuous update(online)

dw:
historical data, qry->cmplx prest general form of data?
  what it means by genral form?
what it means DM orged by subject and ODB orged by transaction???  
why qry accesses entire tables???
bulk(periodic update)

when it talks about usage pattern:
stable,predictable vs var,unpredictable(dw)???
what is usage pattern means?

Application 3 types
---
information processing->ana processing->data mining

basic ana-pro: ???
slice-and-dice
drill down/up
pivoting

data mining:
find hidden pattern and associations.
constructing ana-models,
performing classification and prediction.

DW tools' functions
---
data extraction: from homogeneous data src??? 
    why homogeneous-> similar?
data cleaning:find and correct errors in data
data transformation: legacy -> warehouse format
    what is legacy??
data loading: 
  sort & summarize 
  consolidate 
  check integrity
  build indices and partition???
refreshing:
  updating from data src to WH
  
New words
---
operational db 

ETL:
spending 80-90% time? why it time-consuming?
how imptt it is? how it influence the DW?

Mart:subset of DW(departmentally structured data???)-> for specific user
small in size
customized by dptmt

staging

metadata:
busi -> 
operational -> 

Star schema:
facts and dimensions: facts is in the center and dimensions are its conponents
e.g.
facts: personal infor
dims: name+age+counrty+gender + ....

Data cube:
dimensions-> entities
facts->

Preview:
1>data in CIF:
 -external data:
  ->capability to be manipulated-> cmpr w/ internal data(very malleable)??? why ? 
    what you see is what you get ?? -> not easy to change (structure or the format of the data-> not easy to control)
    it byd the scope of CIF arch.
    what is external key means??? modification ? -> mode it to help ext data to fits the structure of CIF???
    what are the diff btw the row data and external data ???
    imppt in explrtion warehouse ??? 
    
 -reference data
  ->dscrb valid products & product hierarchies ??? as its name suggests
   standerlization ?? ->short-hand -> save disk space.
 -historical data
  ->vlmn of data: longer -> greater
    busi usefulness: more current(the data)-> more relevant to currnt busi
    aggregation of data : more current -> used at detailed level; older -> at summary level ???
    think about the time dimentaion of the data in different stage ??
    indusry->compy->dptmt (up to down)
    project oriented???
 -dss to operational fdbk loop
  -> std flow: cust->app->I&T->ODS/DW->DW->data marts
 -flow of data
  ->back flow: minuscule movement-> big influ.???
2>variations to CIF
3>operational processing and dss processing
4>reporting in CIF
5>User:
 -app user
 -dss/infor user
 -types of dss usage in cif
      1>tourist->find breadth of infor
      2>farmer->predictable
      3>explorer->unpredictability and irregularity
      4>data mining->statisticians(explorer->create assertions and hypotheses) , miner proves the validity/inval of those.
6>centralized or distributed
7>data modeling and cif
8>migragting to cif
9>structing data in cif

7/29 afternoon

Chapter3 External wld cmpnt:
 (transaction producers and infor consumers -> does it means a input and output???)
-Taxonomy of transcations:
 1>direct or indirect
 2>detailed or summary level
 3>immediate or delayed
 4>large or small
 5>wholesale or retail
 6>personal or machine assisted
 7>structured or unstructured
 8>integrated or unintegrated
 9>commercial or retail
-creator of transaction and consumer of information ???
-participants:
 ->consumer, partners, vendors, clerical workers, managers, statisticians
 ->interface
  fast,efficient,convnt,cheap,capable of performing a useful func???, simple to use, scalable.
  
Chapter 4 Application compnt:
 (collection vehicle-> 
  -gathering detailed Transct data, 
   what is detailed T data?? -> how to def? means including all attributes? haven't been pre-processing ? 
  -interact-g directly w/ users
  -auditing and adjusting data ???
  -editing data???
  
  challenge:
  1>collective millstone ard the neck -> once adds new app-> adds weights ->not easy to undstd and mng ??
  2>unintegrated nature?? what does it means lack of integration?
    how to change state from unint to int??
  
  Extro data , Metadata and App
  -meta->keep track of where data is coming from? how data is being used and where data is going???
   how???
   system developer-> living meatadata repository for end-user???
   
  system of record???-> best src of data:
  -complete src
  -accurate src
  -current src
  -most closely conforms to the corporate data model ???
  the data has age -> different place/stage??
  I&T have an imptt task -> selecting the sys of records??-> does it means choose send data to ODS/DW??

Chapter 5 I&T layer
(unlike of DM/ODS/DS-(mainly consisted by data), I&T mainly consisted by program)
???ETL

 Def:
  Application -> I&T (combine and tranform into ) -> corperate data (??? how to def corperate data?? structed and integrated??)
 An unstable interface???
  -complexity ??
  -speed of data movement
  -volumn
 
 Complex integration and transformation interface:
  application data-> Program -> transformed data (the problem is multi links / connect to each other.)
  
 Data model:
  blurprint -> how data shld look in CIF???
  the input of I&T(can be ref-data, external-data and raw detailed data from app)
  Q:
  -the purpose of DW is just for storing data more effectively?
   organize data so that program / machine can find sth useful?
 
 Metadata:
  why said that the metadata can describe the process of transformation ??
  Def:
   data used to represent other data. like a summarized data tht leads to detailed data(index -> content)
   -road-map to DW
   -def the warehouse obj (what kind of data/result you want in the end? )
   -act as a directory/index -> help to locate detailed infor in DW -> like key words when we search ??
   
 Performing key transformation:
  what is key means? key structures? -> most imptt factor/clm of an record???
