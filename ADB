7/23 Week 1
-------------
B4 class
---
Books:
"corporate information factory" by W.H.Inmon which supports up-to-down approach in DW

---
Questions about why we are here?
what kind of goals we needs to archieve when we finished this subjects?
what kind of chanlleges of this industry has faced today and how we can handle thoes problems w/ DH?

feeling
---
the first class is really difficult for me.
although i've prepared a little bit but it's still not enough.

class notes and questions
---
outlines:
1>what is diff btw DW and Operational DB?
2>integration of diff src of data
3>trasaction processing and support
4>data exploration and DM
5>BD magmt

what is DB?
-a collection of records
-shared access -> AC
-a central repository

main components that makes a db.
files  <-> tables
records<-> rows
fields <-> clms

Busi drivers:
consumer demand
competition&complexity
operating efficiencies
->
responding to changes:
BI+BM+BO

who is DW for?
user: manager/DMaker
data:summaries, over time to detect patterns and trends
needs:diff processing rqmts-> rsp time greatly relxed?
      Q:why -> DW's aim is to store multi type of data(not for quick access?
      what does it means? by highly variable -> many types?
Platform:separated from operations
-separate sys? -> what does sys means here ? what functions?
-separate data stores

unstructured data:
hard to find rlshp btw elements/data? X-> 0/1?


DW-DEF-Feature
1>subject-ori -> fcs on modelling & ana of data, not org's ongoing oper??
2>integrated -> put diff type into DW -> increase efficiency of DA
3>time-variant -> it's an imptt dim -> why it's imptt? -> 
  only w/ the time the data can have the trends/ pattern??
4>non-volatile -> historical data won't be updated.

Diff btw OLTP AND OLAP
---
OLTP pvds src to DW than OLAP sys help to ana it.
OLTP: 
fast qry prcs + data integity + multi-access envir + effectiveness
OLAPï¼š
low vlm of tran + qry(cmplx) + resp time(measure) + multi-dimensional schemas

The structure/step of DW:   
operational db-> staging(ETL) -> DW -> Mart 

ODB and DW
odb likes cache? DW likes hardware?

odb:
current data, constructed for known tasks?? search particular rcds?
continuous update(online)

dw:
historical data, qry->cmplx prest general form of data?
  what it means by genral form?
what it means DM orged by subject and ODB orged by transaction???  
why qry accesses entire tables???
bulk(periodic update)

when it talks about usage pattern:
stable,predictable vs var,unpredictable(dw)???
what is usage pattern means?

Application 3 types
---
information processing->ana processing->data mining

basic ana-pro: ???
slice-and-dice
drill down/up
pivoting

data mining:
find hidden pattern and associations.
constructing ana-models,
performing classification and prediction.

DW tools' functions
---
data extraction: from homogeneous data src??? 
    why homogeneous-> similar?
data cleaning:find and correct errors in data
data transformation: legacy -> warehouse format
    what is legacy??
data loading: 
  sort & summarize 
  consolidate 
  check integrity
  build indices and partition???
refreshing:
  updating from data src to WH
  
New words
---
operational db 

ETL:
spending 80-90% time? why it time-consuming?
how imptt it is? how it influence the DW?

Mart:subset of DW(departmentally structured data???)-> for specific user
small in size
customized by dptmt

staging

metadata:
busi -> 
operational -> 

Star schema:

Data cube:
dimensions-> entities
facts->
