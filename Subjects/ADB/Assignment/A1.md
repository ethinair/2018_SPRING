# Summary 1 Sep
Using about seven hours, i finished this assignment.
I waste lots of time(about 1 hour) to check the definition of the 

```
net unit price
gross unit price
discount unit price
extended xxx price
```
During the design process, several questions came up.

## Questions
1 In the example from the book "The Data Warehouse Toolkit" almost all of dimensions have their own PK(named as "DimNmae Key")
  and another Key(the key i think might have the same meaning of the PK ), why this happens?  
  
2 How to decide whether an attribute should in Fact or in Dim?  
  Eg: i have a dim(Promosion), in that table, i include a clm named Reduction price, should this one 
      in the fact table?  
      
3 The Star Schema don't have reference btw diff dims, the rlshp only exists btw the F and Dim.  

4 The fact table exists or just the final product from diff Dim?
  Does it cause the problem of data redundancy in DB?
