# Questions
### 1 when use sigmoid or softmax norm indtd of min-max norm??
A:don't know the min and max of dataset e.g: salary.

min-max-Normalization:
Large range -> smaller range (0-5M -> -1~1) -> some samples may centralized in a smaller range -> other space will be unused Q:

Aim:easy to store, saving storage (mapping??)
machine don't udstd the mean of attri -> 
softmax/sigmoid-Normalization
the range -> asymptote ()
(distotrion)

### 2when we what to bin data?
A:numerical -> categorized data(visulization?)

what is smooth means?

### 3: situation -> attri "age" missing 5/50/500 records of 1000,500?
can we use other attri-> pre classification -> use mean to std it? A: don't use this attri ! 

### 4:binarisation? -> downsides of binarising an attribute?
 ->5 degree -> use 0/1 to std it .
 Q: downside?

### 5:how to choose what kind of nor-method?

### 6:Diff btw binning and normalization

---
Binning:
1>equal width
2>equal depth
 ->what if a sample

### 7 how to choose the num of your bin?
A:why you bin ? -> can your bin tell you the infor of the data

we only find rlshp btw two diff attri? (scatter matrix)?
