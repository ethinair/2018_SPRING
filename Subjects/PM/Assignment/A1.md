- what is the diff btw the project scope and product scope?  
  it was said the [product scope](https://www.izenbridge.com/blog/product-scope-vs-project-scope/) focus on feature of the product.  
  using this case study:  
    we are trying to build a system(website is a part of the system), this system is a digital publishing system.  
    how can you def the feature? do we need to include the different parts of the systems?
