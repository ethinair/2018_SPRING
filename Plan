After talking with W he told me i different courses should occupies various study time.
for example->you should spend most of your time on core subject here which means ADB and FDA, also spent time on math and python.

DS is an Interdisciplinary that combined by program, statistic and analysis skills.
And as a master student we should focus on doing research and presentations. not just on basic knowledge since if basic principle
occupy you lots of time you won't get enough time to do other things.

So this semester my aim is to get HD in 4 subjects.
Through my personal project to learn python. aparts from that learning i must finish single calculus and statistics.

there a lots of knowledges i want to learn. but the time is limited. you should use limited time to create maximum value.
having a clear purpose of this semester. don't push yourself too much. realizing the priority.

Four subject:
1>fundermental data analytics
this subject is your first career subject, the tutor is Paul, and you can follow him to do your master's thesis, but you need
reservate least 1 semester in advance.
the SW will be used in this subject is Knime and the William said you can also use python to finish the homeworks and that's
what most of local students did.

So for this subject, you need to learn python, some basic statistic knowledge, and sw.
the most imptt thing is the ability to collect infor/data -> cleaning data -> analyise data -> generate report and data visulazation.

the questions you needs ask:
-what kinds of technologies can be used in this industry?
-the process of data analysis?
-what types of DA there are? -> how many levels there are as to the DA?
-every company needs da -> what is means to them?
-how ppl/busi treat da from past to now to future?
-what kind of value it can bring to the busi?
-how it related to my projects?

2>advanced database
this subject is difficult since the content of the lecture is deep knowledge and contains many terminology(concepts).
so need to read index of the CIF to help me udstd it. also needs to know 

-what are technologies we are using ? in which big company or unicorn?
-how those technologies are implemented in modern industry? 
-what kind of challenge we need to face?
-how this industry related to other industry? 
-what tech make it available?
-how it improve ppl's life/ living enviroment?
