when i try to add extensions, there are several extensions can not be reached.

how to learn a sw quickly -> learn by doing it.

data mining is the process to building models?-> so what is model?
it's mathematical equations->find the pattern.

Models-def:
-capture essence (abstract meaning)
-help to udstd wld -> most of things in our life has pattern -> find/abstract it
-predict future/what will happen to a custormer' behaviour

Data explosion
what are effects of data explosion?
how can we use it?

Nate Silver-> statistician ->predict 

asking right questions:
what are the trends in cust'behavior -> how to build cust profiles
when you really know someone -> find out what they needs by observe them->analyse

After class
--
This class will talk a little bit about DA AND AI. -> methodolygy.

Dataset:
1>script-> descriptive(clustering) ??
2>predictive

week4:
neutural network, normalization
week6-8:
tree->forest
week11:
mkt Da, hospital child cancer.

Ass
--
1>job-> attributes->skills->plan,summary why choose it? -> think about Q assess interviewee
2>visual+normalization, ana dataset, find value,
3>prdict model->presentation->why you choose this topic, how you solve the problem?

Others
--
IAPA skill survey
vender->da consultant
explain what's your model doing?

Programme:
R,python,SAS

Q:
how to make sure your model available?
how good our model is ???

KNIEM
--
-put NODES-> nodes do the job of ML -> does it means that nodes is acturally the visual version of algorithm?
-use quickstart guide

Node:
1>XLS:String, TimeAndDate, Double, Boolean, and Int.
  why it was said large file -> formula reevaluation ???
  rowID -> unique? 
  ports -> output ports -> 0 the data table read in??
  
2>color manager
3>scatter plot
  you can select plots and hiliting them -> find them in XLS's output table
  X-Y the number change the range of the showing table
4>partitioning
  input tbl-> 2 partitions
  1 inputP and 2 outputP(1st def in dialog?? 2nd remaining rows?)
  this NODES take apart the raw dataset into two subsets???-> training and testing
  diff ?? btw absolute and relative ??
  random seed?
5>decision tree learner
  1 inP(pre-classified data used to induce the DT) + 1 outP(induced DT -> model)
  tget attr-> must nominal(other is numerical) ???
  num split-> 2
  nom split-> 2 - N
  gini index?? gain ratio?? -> for quality measures
  post pruning method -> reduce T size incrs predct accrcy?? how ?
    A:Pruning -> ML tech, rdc size of DT -> by remv sections of tree(pvd little power to classsify instances)
6>decision tree predictor
  2 ipt(model + data that you needs to classify) + 1 opt (input tbl + a clm)
7>scorer
  cmpr 2 clms by their attri valu pairs??? and shows confusion matrix??
  -> how good our model is ? 
  -> is there wrong output ? -> what are those samples are?

Q:
-what is diff btw SW and python (NODES is codes/function/algr)?

the four parts:
data reading -> pre-processing -> train a model -> score the model

PS:
-spaCy
-scikit-learn
