 What should we do about a small project?
 ->Do not spend more "time money rsc effort" than it takes to do the P.
 1>task list -> accd this to assign rsc

 4>set due day
 5>Doc -> don't need version control ???
 6>track time/$ -> don't needs EVA ana????
 ->keep it simple
 
 what about IT project?
 ->P(busi+prodct+pm-delivery ???)
 hdwr web db infrastracture internet storage disaster-recovery
 (what does it means make it deliverable ??? ->tangible/intang G/S as reslt of a P)
 ->factors:
 1>multi vender -> diff expectations/process(work flow??)
 2>changing version/release -> keep your eyes on moniter -> up to data
 3>complex depdcy ???

 project's value/proposition
 ->(mov:measurable organizational value -> why call it measurable? -> means available? feasibility??)
 
 Value chain:

 | org goal -> org sttgy -> pjt value/proposition |
 "->" : driver 
 "<-" : support
 diff goal means use diff sttgy to archv it.
 what is diff btw goal and value ???
  -> goal means what we need to do/achv, value means benefits (long term or short term , Predictability ??)

 6>clearly and consisly summrz value sttmt -> this not include how to archv goal!!!
 E.g.
  what it will bring(matric) if successd -> how much?
  by a particular point of time ->when?
  MOV= measurable + agreed on + timeframe <-> Matric + timeframe + what it is
