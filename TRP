last day i attended a class w/ i think maybe 150-200 stds in that class.From diff backgrds/majors
The tutor's name is Sam. and i also meet two RSC students-> Tim(online education) & Tom(design digitial tech to empower local communi)

Q:
what is Rsch?
  bkgrd->aim->methodology->discuss->conclusion
what its essential ele?
  -building on previous work(other's rsch)
  -hypothesis(a statmt of how two or more var are related? )+why we do rsch?!!!
  -collect data-> ana & findings, deep ana/ frame/generalisation ??
  -interpretation
  -furthering infor(be used by others)
  
what is a good rsch?
Sam said:
  most of Rsh try to avoid opinions??
  smtms -> data is correct but -> is wrong ??

Rsch meth:
sysmtic plan->conducting rsch. (qualitative/quantitative)
  experiments, participant obervation, 2ndry data, survey rsch
  -quantitative meth:
    classify features,count them, create stat models -> test hypotheses and explain observations 
  -qualitative meth:
    a complete, detailed dscrption of observtion -> context of events+circumstances
  -experiments:
    investigating cause + effect under highly controlled conditions ???
    indpdt var(cause)-> depdt var(effect) 
    experimental grp vs control grp (whether exposed to the indpdt var)
    
 Assignment
 aim-> literature review + research proposal

Lec2
-dff btw rsch and profession
-how to find hig quality XXX

how to convince ppl more effictively?
how to def pjt proposal ??

12 find 1 ？
M1:
1 6
2 3
3 1 vs 1

M2:
4 4 4
2 2
1 1

Use methodolgy to solve a problem -> does it have meaning ?
how much we already know ?? b4 do a rsch?  -> literacal review.

diff btw acd and industry:
1>feasibility -> short time 
2>thero -> practice 
3>w/i a boundary($ rsc)
4>customer focued ???
5>make wegdt

context -> domian -> bkgrd
fb rsch

Q: why you choose to blv it ?
-from authentic jounal?
-writer is famous in this industry/ field?
-the rsch is  -> time horizen long 
-the sample it used / m 

???

would i make a busi deci/invest $ based on this infor ??
what is info and what is bias?

One:eva src
1>selct your rsc to read(diff voculy same concept)
2>abstr what is idea?
